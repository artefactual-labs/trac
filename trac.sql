However, the archive\'s overriding  practice has been to accept the researcher\'s decision, since she/he  remains the true owner of the data.

That will give  the reader a good sense for how things are working today, but leaves  open the possibility (likelihood?) that ICPSR may change its mission  statement, submission agreements, and/or other possibilities down the  road, and then the underlying technology will change too.<br /><br />The  short version of the story is that ICPSR captures two essential items  from each submission: the data (normalized into plain ASCII characters),  and the technical documentation (normalized into DDI XML, PDF, and TIF  images). And we keep the content in these formats until we need to  migrate to a different format.<br /><br />In our world of survey research  data there is no requirement to preserve original formats (such as a SAS  Portable file), look and feel (such as original technical documentation  written in Word Perfect), or even low-level data format (such as  numeric data coded in punched card format). We can take everything, pull  out the essential intellectual content, and then normalize that content  in quite durable formats.<br /><br />That said, we may take these durable  formats, such as DDI XML metadata and plain ASCII data, and feed them  into tools that produce dissemination formats that are easier for our  designated community to use. This includes common stat package formats,  and also includes formats that feed into our on-line analysis system.  However, these dissemination formats are not preserved, and they contain  no essential properties not also contained in the preservation formats.<br /><br />As  I\'ve been thinking about this particular TRAC requirement over the past  week, I think we\'re probably missing one important piece of information  for each of our data files: the character set. In practice almost all  of our holdings are numeric data, and so our implicit character set  (\"us-ascii\") is the correct one to use, but this seems like a good area  for being more explicit. This would allow us to handle data files that  contain non-numeric, non-US-ASCII characters in a more durable  fashion.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(27,27,'B.

But there are two key areas  worth  discussing that fall within the purview of IT.<br /><br />One area is   ensuring that ICPSR is able to deliver its content to its clients,   members, and the public at all time.  This is an area where we\'ve made   significant investments over the past twelve months, and where we also   now have a good story to tell.<br /><br />The main ICPSR delivery mechanism   is its web site.  The technological resources that power the primary   instance of the web site reside at ICPSR itself on the campus of the   University of Michigan.  This consists of three mains systems:  a   reasonably powerful server running web applications; another powerful   server running an Oracle database; and our storage appliance.<br /><br />Our   equipment resides in an eclectic machine room.  On the plus side it  has  items one would expect to find like equipment cabinets, local air   handlers providing chilled air, and UPS to protect us from power   fluctuations.  On the negative side there is no raised floor or cable   trays, which makes for a messy machine room, and our connection to Ann   Arbor\'s (not U-M\'s) electrical grid is somewhat precarious.  An off-site   network operations center monitors our gear 24 x 7 and notifies us via   SMS, pager, and telephone if anything looks broken.<br /><br />We maintain  a  replica of our web environment in Amazon\'s cloud, and we use a  simple  mechanism to trigger a failover to the replica:  The oncall  technician  changes the DNS record for www.icpsr.umich.edu to point to  the replica  instead of the primary.  The time-to-live on the record is  low (five  minutes), and so once the process has been followed, failover  is quick.   (And the change is made on a \"stealth\" DNS server that also  lives in  Amazon\'s cloud.)<br /><br />And, finally, we synchronize the replica several times throughout the workday so that software and content is always fresh.<br /><br />This   setup doesn\'t create a web environment which promises \"five nines\"  type  of uptime (i.e., 99.999% availability), but it does give us the   capability to avoid any long multi-day outage like we saw late in 2008,   and it also gives us the capability to deliver content indefinitely  from  the replica should ICPSR stuffer a disaster.<br /><br />The second  main  area where IT plays a key role is with archival storage.  This is  less  about 24 x 7 availability, and more about ensuring that our  archival  holdings are available for long-term access in a robust  storage fabric.<br /><br />A <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/11/icpsr-content-and-availability.html\">post from November 2009</a> is still an accurate depiction of how we replicate our archival   holdings so that we can be guaranteed to have a copy even if something   catastrophic happens to our main location in Ann Arbor.

Because this content is freely  available via our web site (albeit some only to members) there are  relatively few concerns about its security. It\'s important that we know  that the objects haven\'t been corrupted (unintentionally or otherwise),  and it\'s also important to ensure that member-only content is accessible  only to members.<br /><br />The second category has grown considerably in  the past few years, particularly as ICPSR receives more confidential  data through government agencies, partners, and unsolicited via its  deposit system.<br /><br />To meet the rising challenge of confidential data  ICPSR will be changing the architecture of its network, and will also  be deploying a Secure Data processing Environment. (More on the SDE in a  subsequent post.) Both of these steps supplement existing security  controls that we discussed in the post <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/09/icpsr-web-site-and-security.html\">The ICPSR Web Site and Security</a> from September 2009.<br /><br />Our  current network architecture is very flat. All network-connected  equipment is part of a single virtual local area network (VLAN), and  items are protected at the border between ICPSR and the outside world  via Cisco access-list policies. Individual systems may also be protected  via local firewalls, such as iptables on a Linux server. And equipment  located in Amazon\'s cloud is protected via similar mechanisms using AWS  EC2 Security Groups.<br /><br />Our new network architecture will look very different, and will consist of four separate VLANs. Here is the overall picture:</p><p>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2WmjUV0qSjA/S3mRnNlbz0I/AAAAAAAAAMw/uW4qtF0VNH0/s1600-h/ICPSR+LAN+with+VFW.png<br /><br />This  new architecture makes use of a new security service provided by the  University of Michigan\'s central IT organization, ITS. The service is  called Virtual Firewall, and is based on the Checkpoint firewall  product.<br /><br />This architecture divides ICPSR\'s network-connected resources into four VLANs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Public<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Semi-private<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Private (local to ICPSR)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Private (local to ITS)<br /><br />The  Public VLAN hosts ICPSR\'s public-facing resources, such as the web  server. This is a relatively small VLAN, and one can imagine resources  moving from this VLAN into Amazon\'s cloud over time. (In fact, a  multi-region delivery platform stretched across Amazon\'s international  cloud, perhaps using AWS CloudFront to deliver especially high-volume  objects is very compelling.)<br /><br />The Semi-private VLAN hosts the bulk  of ICPSR\'s current systems: desktop computers, printers, storage  systems, and so on. This equipment needs robust outbound access to the  Internet, but inbound access should be restricted closely. For example,  there is no good reason why ICPSR\'s printers need to be accessible from  any arbitrary host on the Internet.<br /><br />The Private VLANs will host  our most secure systems. This will include the Secure Data processing  Environment (SDE) we\'re building, and also a future Virtual Data Enclave  (VDE). Access between these VLANs and the Internet will be highly,  highly restricted, and more general access will be permitted only from  our Semi-private VLAN.<br /><br />We\'ve just started the process of building  out this future network architecture with ITS, and expect that we\'ll  finish the deployment and transition before the end of the summer.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(56,56,'B.

If most campuses were using, say, IBM labeled  cartridge tapes routinely but ICPSR was sending ANSI labeled 9-track  tapes, this would have imposed an additional burden on our designated  community. However, in a world where the typical access is via a Web  download, the underlying hardware selection - disk, server, router,  switch - just doesn\'t matter all that much.<br /><br />Also, because ICPSR\'s  unit of delivery is relatively small - most of our content is on the  order of megabytes - issues such as network bandwidth are not critical.  In a typical day ICPSR might deliver 20GB of content to hundreds or even  thousands of separate sessions, and so with even modest networking  resources (1 Gb/s NIC, 1 Gb/s switch, 10 Gb/s campus backbone, etc), the  \"pipes\" are more than sufficient to deliver good service.<br /><br />One  interesting area to consider with regard to hardware selection is  virtualization. For example, in some cases it might make more sense for a  depositor to leave ICPSR with an image of a complete computing system  in addition to a dataset. In most cases the deposit contains simple  rectangular data that can be normalized relatively easily into plain  character data and accompanying \"setups\" to make it easy to use with the  most common statistical packages. However, if the dataset were more  complex - say a relational database - then normalizing the data could be  prohibitively expensive, or damaging to the data, or both. In this  case, having a machine image that would contain a host operating system,  the database application, and the user database might be a useful  addition both for preservation and delivery.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(62,62,'B.

Fortunately for our data holdings (but unfortunately for TRAC  preparation), data loss or corruption is a very infrequent event, and  therefore as one might expect, the set of policies and written processes  is pretty small.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, if we look at our  policies and processes for handling loss with \"working files\" we will  find a much richer set of policies and systems. We have established  infrastructure (an EMC Network Attached Storage (NAS) storage applicance  and associated Dell tape management solution); we have internal  policies and processes that document how to retrieve lost content; we  have external policies that describe which parts of the NAS are written  to tape, and the schedule of tape backups; and, we exercise the system  on a regular basis as people inadvertently delete or damage files with  which they are working actively.<br /><br />On the Archival Storage side -  or even the Access side, where we also look for loss and corruption -  the number of data loss or data corruption events is very, very low.  Email reports come out on a regular basis, but they always (almost) say  that everything is fine. And on that rare occasion where there is an  issue, the remedy is quick.<br /><br />Perhaps the right solution here is to  use the small sample of issues that have arisen over the years as our  baseline for writing up a process, and then posting that process on our  internal web site. That would be easy to do. But then the concern is  this: If a policy is used very, very infrequently, it is likely to fall  into disrepair. It is also likely to become forgotten.

Automated, regularly scheduled  system jobs synchronize those objects with remote locations using  standard, established tools such as rsync and other, less common tools  such as Storage Resource Broker (SRB) command-line utilities, such as  Srsync.<br /><br />The output of these system jobs is captured and delivered  nightly to a shared electronic mailbox. The mailbox is reviewed on a  daily basis; this task belongs to the member of the ICPSR IT team who is  currently on-call. When a report is missing or when a report indicates  an error, the problem is escalated to someone who can diagnose and  correct the problem. One common problem, for example, occurs when an  object larger than 2GB enters Archival Storage and the SRB Srsync  utility faults. (SRB limits objects to 2GB.) We then remove this object  from the list of items to be synchronized with SRB.<br /><br />Because the  synchronization process is incremental, it has a very short duration.  However, if we were to need to synchronize ALL content, this takes on  the order of days or even weeks. For example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Access holdings to a computing instance residing in  Amazon\'s EC2 EU-West region, and we found it took approximately one week  to copy about 500GB. As another example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Archival Storage (which is much larger than the Access  collection) to a system, which like ICPSR and the University of  Michigan, is connected to Internet2\'s Abilene network, and that took far  less time.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(73,73,'C.

And for the second (tape) copy, we too can easily specify the  location as long as we\'re not too specific. For example, we can point to  the tape library and say, \"It\'s in there.\" And, of course, with a  little more work, we can use our tape management system to point us to  the specific tape, and the location on that tape. Maintaining this  information outside of the tape management system would be expensive,  and it\'s not clear if there would be any true benefit.<br /><br />The  location of other copies can be derived easily, but those specific  locations are not recorded in a database. For example, let\'s say that  the master copy of every original deposit we have is stored in a  filesystem hierarchy like /archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s say that on a daily basis we synchronize that content via <em>rsync </em>to an off-site location, say, <strong>remote-location.icpsr.umich.edu:</strong>/archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s also say that someone reviews the output of the <em>rsync </em>run on a daily basis, and also performs a random spot-check on an irregular basis.<br /><br />In  this scenario we might have a large degree of confidence that we could  find a copy of any given deposit on that off-site location. We know it\'s  there because <em>rsync </em>told us it put it there. But we don\'t have a  central catalog that says that deposit #1234 is stored under  /archival-storage/deposits/1234, on tape, and at  remote-site.icpsr.umich.edu/archival-storage/deposits/1234. One could  build exactly such a catalog, of course, and then create the process to  keep it up to date, but would it have much value? What if all we did was  tell a wrapper around rsync to capture the output and update the  catalog?<br /><br />Probably not.<br /><br />And so if we interpret the TRAC  requirement to build a location register to mean that we should have a  complete, enumerated list of each and every copy, then we don\'t do so  well here. But if we interpret the requirement to mean that we can find a  copy by looking on a list (i.e., the catalog proper) or look at a rule  (i.e., if the master copy is in location x, then two other copies can be  found by applying functions <em>f(x)</em> and <em>g(x)</em>), then we\'re doing pretty well after all.<br /><br />Limitations  in storage systems also add complexity. For instance, I was once  looking at Amazon\'s S3 as a possible location for items in archival  storage. But S3 doesn\'t let me have objects bigger than 5GB, and since I  sometimes have very large files, this means that the record-keeping  would be even more complicated. <em>For an object with name X, you can  find it in this S3 bucket, unless it is bigger than 5GB, in which case  you need to look for N different objects and join them together.</em> Ick.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(74,74,'C.

The process has been used twice in 2009, once as a test, and once  when the Ann Arbor site suffered a power failure.<br /><br />ICPSR has a  less well documented, but fairly prosaic, backup solution in place. All  non-ephemeral content at ICPSR resides on a large Network Attached  Storage (NAS) appliance. The IT team has configured the NAS to  \"checkpoint\" each filesystem once per day, and each checkpoint is  retained for 30 days. Checkpoints provide a read-only, self-serve backup  system for those instances where a member of the staff has  inadvertently damaged or destroyed non-archival content.<br /><br />Further,  we write all filesystems to a tape library, which is located in a  different machine room than the NAS. Every two weeks tapes are removed  from the tape library, and stored in yet a different building. We retain  the last four weekly backups, and the last twelve monthly backups. The  system is exercised on an infrequent, but regular basis when we restore  files that were damaged or destroyed beyond the thirty day checkpoint  window.<br /><br />Finally, unlike \"working\" files where all copies reside  locally, and where we retain only one year of content, our archival  storage solution consists of copies in at least four locations.

Linux, of course, is a very widely deployed open source variant  of UNIX, and Red Hat is a world leader in supporting Linux. ICPSR had  previously used proprietary operating systems, but moved all of its  systems to Red Hat Linux in the decade.<br /><br />Moving up in the stack of  our core technology infrastructure we use several pieces of software  from the Apache Software Foundation, a very large community of  developers and users. In addition to the flagship HTTP Server, we also  use the tomcat servlet container for all of our Java-based web  applications, the Solr search engine which is built atop the Lucene Java  search technology, and the cocoon framework for rendering XML into  other formats.<br /><br />ICPSR also builds and maintains a suite of custom  software for key business processes, such as our Data Deposit Form  (ingest), our download system (access), and our data processing systems  (data management, ingest, access). While this software is necessarily  proprietary, it is written in common, modern software languages such as  Perl and Java, which have wide support in the community.<br /><br />Like  many, many enterprises, ICPSR uses Oracle as its database system. Given  the large installed base of Oracle across the world, ICPSR views this as  a well-supported platform. We believe we can continue to use Oracle as  long as the University of Michigan continues to make it freely available  to us. Further, we make use of only the most basic elements of Oracle,  and if required, it would be straight-forward, but not insignificant, to  migrate our content to any other relational database technology, such  as postgres or mysql. Our one highly customized use of Oracle, and  therefore the one that carries the most risk, is the OracleText-based  search engine for the Child Care site, is scheduled to be replaced in  early 2010.<br /><br />And finally, we are actively migrating our own  proprietary archival storage system to the Fedora system, which is  supported by the newly created DuraSpace organization. Other than  internally created systems, Fedora probably has the smallest community  of support of any of our major technology systems, but because it is  open source and gaining traction in the community, we believe its level  of support will continue to grow over time. And further, because the  underlying content resides in plain XML files, even with a sudden and  catastrophic loss of Fedora, it would still be possible to migrate  content to another system.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(77,77,'B.

Upon  receipt of a deposit, ICPSR processes the digital content to ensure  that confidential information has not been included in the data;  corrects errors; fills gaps in the documentation; and produces  distribution versions of the data. Technicians digitize documentation  that is received only in hard copy format. ICPSR archives the original  digital content received, the normalized versions of processed data, and  superseded versions of data that have been distributed. The archived  files will enable ICPSR to retain the ability to regenerate distribution  formats over time. For files submitted on physical storage media, ICPSR  makes archival copies but does not preserve the original transmission  media.

The following examples are paraphrased from an email from Erik Austin,  retired Assistant Director of ICPSR.&nbsp; A PI had not cleared deposit of  the data with a co-PI; the latter eventually agreed to leave the data  with ICPSR.&nbsp; In another example, the researcher had fogotten that he had  deposited the data.&nbsp; A copy of the permission form with his signature  was sufficient to clear up the misunderstanding.&nbsp; Related examples  include instances where the researcher disapproved of something done to  the data in processing.&nbsp; [RMC]</p><p>The general practice has been to  negotiate with the researcher, attempting to explain ICPSR\'s actions and  convince him/her of their value. However, the archive\'s overriding  practice has been to accept the researcher\'s decision, since she/he  remains the true owner of the data.

That will give  the reader a good sense for how things are working today, but leaves  open the possibility (likelihood?) that ICPSR may change its mission  statement, submission agreements, and/or other possibilities down the  road, and then the underlying technology will change too.<br /><br />The  short version of the story is that ICPSR captures two essential items  from each submission: the data (normalized into plain ASCII characters),  and the technical documentation (normalized into DDI XML, PDF, and TIF  images). And we keep the content in these formats until we need to  migrate to a different format.<br /><br />In our world of survey research  data there is no requirement to preserve original formats (such as a SAS  Portable file), look and feel (such as original technical documentation  written in Word Perfect), or even low-level data format (such as  numeric data coded in punched card format). We can take everything, pull  out the essential intellectual content, and then normalize that content  in quite durable formats.<br /><br />That said, we may take these durable  formats, such as DDI XML metadata and plain ASCII data, and feed them  into tools that produce dissemination formats that are easier for our  designated community to use. This includes common stat package formats,  and also includes formats that feed into our on-line analysis system.  However, these dissemination formats are not preserved, and they contain  no essential properties not also contained in the preservation formats.<br /><br />As  I\'ve been thinking about this particular TRAC requirement over the past  week, I think we\'re probably missing one important piece of information  for each of our data files: the character set. In practice almost all  of our holdings are numeric data, and so our implicit character set  (\"us-ascii\") is the correct one to use, but this seems like a good area  for being more explicit. This would allow us to handle data files that  contain non-numeric, non-US-ASCII characters in a more durable  fashion.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(114,27,'B.

Upon  receipt of a deposit, ICPSR processes the digital content to ensure  that confidential information has not been included in the data;  corrects errors; fills gaps in the documentation; and produces  distribution versions of the data. Technicians digitize documentation  that is received only in hard copy format. ICPSR archives the original  digital content received, the normalized versions of processed data, and  superseded versions of data that have been distributed. The archived  files will enable ICPSR to retain the ability to regenerate distribution  formats over time.

Linux, of course, is a very widely deployed open source variant  of UNIX, and Red Hat is a world leader in supporting Linux. ICPSR had  previously used proprietary operating systems, but moved all of its  systems to Red Hat Linux in the decade.<br /><br />Moving up in the stack of  our core technology infrastructure we use several pieces of software  from the Apache Software Foundation, a very large community of  developers and users. In addition to the flagship HTTP Server, we also  use the tomcat servlet container for all of our Java-based web  applications, the Solr search engine which is built atop the Lucene Java  search technology, and the cocoon framework for rendering XML into  other formats.<br /><br />ICPSR also builds and maintains a suite of custom  software for key business processes, such as our Data Deposit Form  (ingest), our download system (access), and our data processing systems  (data management, ingest, access). While this software is necessarily  proprietary, it is written in common, modern software languages such as  Perl and Java, which have wide support in the community.<br /><br />Like  many, many enterprises, ICPSR uses Oracle as its database system. Given  the large installed base of Oracle across the world, ICPSR views this as  a well-supported platform. We believe we can continue to use Oracle as  long as the University of Michigan continues to make it freely available  to us. Further, we make use of only the most basic elements of Oracle,  and if required, it would be straight-forward, but not insignificant, to  migrate our content to any other relational database technology, such  as postgres or mysql. Our one highly customized use of Oracle, and  therefore the one that carries the most risk, is the OracleText-based  search engine for the Child Care site, is scheduled to be replaced in  early 2010.<br /><br />And finally, we are actively migrating our own  proprietary archival storage system to the Fedora system, which is  supported by the newly created DuraSpace organization. Other than  internally created systems, Fedora probably has the smallest community  of support of any of our major technology systems, but because it is  open source and gaining traction in the community, we believe its level  of support will continue to grow over time. And further, because the  underlying content resides in plain XML files, even with a sudden and  catastrophic loss of Fedora, it would still be possible to migrate  content to another system.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(158,63,'C.

The documentation - planning documents  and instructions - reside in a Google Group, and all members of the IT  team, and two of ICPSR\'s senior staff outside of IT are members of the  group. The process has been used twice in 2009, once as a test, and once  when the Ann Arbor site suffered a power failure.<br /><br />ICPSR has a  less well documented, but fairly prosaic, backup solution in place. All  non-ephemeral content at ICPSR resides on a large Network Attached  Storage (NAS) appliance. The IT team has configured the NAS to  \"checkpoint\" each filesystem once per day, and each checkpoint is  retained for 30 days. Checkpoints provide a read-only, self-serve backup  system for those instances where a member of the staff has  inadvertently damaged or destroyed non-archival content.<br /><br />Further,  we write all filesystems to a tape library, which is located in a  different machine room than the NAS. Every two weeks tapes are removed  from the tape library, and stored in yet a different building. We retain  the last four weekly backups, and the last twelve monthly backups. The  system is exercised on an infrequent, but regular basis when we restore  files that were damaged or destroyed beyond the thirty day checkpoint  window.<br /><br />Finally, unlike \"working\" files where all copies reside  locally, and where we retain only one year of content, our archival  storage solution consists of copies in at least four locations. The  master copy (1) is on the NAS; a copy (2) is written to tape each month;  a copy (3) is synchronized daily with the San Diego Supercomputer  Center\'s storage grid; and, a copy (4) is synchronized daily with the  MATRIX Center at Michigan State University. Furthermore, archival  content collected prior to 2009 has also been copied into the  Chronopolis project storage grid, which adds two additional copies.<br /><br />One  area with room for improvement would be regular \"fire drills\" where we  would attempt to retrieve a random number of random objects from an  arbitrarily selected archival storage location.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(160,73,'C.

And for the second (tape) copy, we too can easily specify the  location as long as we\'re not too specific. For example, we can point to  the tape library and say, \"It\'s in there.\" And, of course, with a  little more work, we can use our tape management system to point us to  the specific tape, and the location on that tape. Maintaining this  information outside of the tape management system would be expensive,  and it\'s not clear if there would be any true benefit.<br /><br />The  location of other copies can be derived easily, but those specific  locations are not recorded in a database. For example, let\'s say that  the master copy of every original deposit we have is stored in a  filesystem hierarchy like /archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s say that on a daily basis we synchronize that content via <em>rsync </em>to an off-site location, say, <strong>remote-location.icpsr.umich.edu:</strong>/archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s also say that someone reviews the output of the <em>rsync </em>run on a daily basis, and also performs a random spot-check on an irregular basis.<br /><br />In  this scenario we might have a large degree of confidence that we could  find a copy of any given deposit on that off-site location. We know it\'s  there because <em>rsync </em>told us it put it there. But we don\'t have a  central catalog that says that deposit #1234 is stored under  /archival-storage/deposits/1234, on tape, and at  remote-site.icpsr.umich.edu/archival-storage/deposits/1234. One could  build exactly such a catalog, of course, and then create the process to  keep it up to date, but would it have much value? What if all we did was  tell a wrapper around rsync to capture the output and update the  catalog?<br /><br />Probably not.<br /><br />And so if we interpret the TRAC  requirement to build a location register to mean that we should have a  complete, enumerated list of each and every copy, then we don\'t do so  well here. But if we interpret the requirement to mean that we can find a  copy by looking on a list (i.e., the catalog proper) or look at a rule  (i.e., if the master copy is in location x, then two other copies can be  found by applying functions <em>f(x)</em> and <em>g(x)</em>), then we\'re doing pretty well after all.<br /><br />Limitations  in storage systems also add complexity. For instance, I was once  looking at Amazon\'s S3 as a possible location for items in archival  storage. But S3 doesn\'t let me have objects bigger than 5GB, and since I  sometimes have very large files, this means that the record-keeping  would be even more complicated. <em>For an object with name X, you can  find it in this S3 bucket, unless it is bigger than 5GB, in which case  you need to look for N different objects and join them together.</em> Ick.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(161,72,'C.

One common problem, for example, occurs when an  object larger than 2GB enters Archival Storage and the SRB Srsync  utility faults. (SRB limits objects to 2GB.) We then remove this object  from the list of items to be synchronized with SRB.<br /><br />Because the  synchronization process is incremental, it has a very short duration.  However, if we were to need to synchronize ALL content, this takes on  the order of days or even weeks. For example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Access holdings to a computing instance residing in  Amazon\'s EC2 EU-West region, and we found it took approximately one week  to copy about 500GB. As another example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Archival Storage (which is much larger than the Access  collection) to a system, which like ICPSR and the University of  Michigan, is connected to Internet2\'s Abilene network, and that took far  less time.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(162,70,'C.

We have established  infrastructure (an EMC Network Attached Storage (NAS) storage applicance  and associated Dell tape management solution); we have internal  policies and processes that document how to retrieve lost content; we  have external policies that describe which parts of the NAS are written  to tape, and the schedule of tape backups; and, we exercise the system  on a regular basis as people inadvertently delete or damage files with  which they are working actively.<br /><br />On the Archival Storage side -  or even the Access side, where we also look for loss and corruption -  the number of data loss or data corruption events is very, very low.  Email reports come out on a regular basis, but they always (almost) say  that everything is fine. And on that rare occasion where there is an  issue, the remedy is quick.<br /><br />Perhaps the right solution here is to  use the small sample of issues that have arisen over the years as our  baseline for writing up a process, and then posting that process on our  internal web site. That would be easy to do. But then the concern is  this: If a policy is used very, very infrequently, it is likely to fall  into disrepair. It is also likely to become forgotten.

If most campuses were using, say, IBM labeled  cartridge tapes routinely but ICPSR was sending ANSI labeled 9-track  tapes, this would have imposed an additional burden on our designated  community. However, in a world where the typical access is via a Web  download, the underlying hardware selection - disk, server, router,  switch - just doesn\'t matter all that much.<br /><br />Also, because ICPSR\'s  unit of delivery is relatively small - most of our content is on the  order of megabytes - issues such as network bandwidth are not critical.  In a typical day ICPSR might deliver 20GB of content to hundreds or even  thousands of separate sessions, and so with even modest networking  resources (1 Gb/s NIC, 1 Gb/s switch, 10 Gb/s campus backbone, etc), the  \"pipes\" are more than sufficient to deliver good service.<br /><br />One  interesting area to consider with regard to hardware selection is  virtualization. For example, in some cases it might make more sense for a  depositor to leave ICPSR with an image of a complete computing system  in addition to a dataset. In most cases the deposit contains simple  rectangular data that can be normalized relatively easily into plain  character data and accompanying \"setups\" to make it easy to use with the  most common statistical packages. However, if the dataset were more  complex - say a relational database - then normalizing the data could be  prohibitively expensive, or damaging to the data, or both. In this  case, having a machine image that would contain a host operating system,  the database application, and the user database might be a useful  addition both for preservation and delivery.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(168,59,'C.

But there are two key areas  worth  discussing that fall within the purview of IT.<br /><br />One area is   ensuring that ICPSR is able to deliver its content to its clients,   members, and the public at all time.  This is an area where we\'ve made   significant investments over the past twelve months, and where we also   now have a good story to tell.<br /><br />The main ICPSR delivery mechanism   is its web site.  The technological resources that power the primary   instance of the web site reside at ICPSR itself on the campus of the   University of Michigan.  This consists of three mains systems:  a   reasonably powerful server running web applications; another powerful   server running an Oracle database; and our storage appliance.<br /><br />Our   equipment resides in an eclectic machine room.  On the plus side it  has  items one would expect to find like equipment cabinets, local air   handlers providing chilled air, and UPS to protect us from power   fluctuations.  On the negative side there is no raised floor or cable   trays, which makes for a messy machine room, and our connection to Ann   Arbor\'s (not U-M\'s) electrical grid is somewhat precarious.  An off-site   network operations center monitors our gear 24 x 7 and notifies us via   SMS, pager, and telephone if anything looks broken.<br /><br />We maintain  a  replica of our web environment in Amazon\'s cloud, and we use a  simple  mechanism to trigger a failover to the replica:  The oncall  technician  changes the DNS record for www.icpsr.umich.edu to point to  the replica  instead of the primary.  The time-to-live on the record is  low (five  minutes), and so once the process has been followed, failover  is quick.   (And the change is made on a \"stealth\" DNS server that also  lives in  Amazon\'s cloud.)<br /><br />And, finally, we synchronize the replica several times throughout the workday so that software and content is always fresh.<br /><br />This   setup doesn\'t create a web environment which promises \"five nines\"  type  of uptime (i.e., 99.999% availability), but it does give us the   capability to avoid any long multi-day outage like we saw late in 2008,   and it also gives us the capability to deliver content indefinitely  from  the replica should ICPSR stuffer a disaster.<br /><br />The second  main  area where IT plays a key role is with archival storage.  This is  less  about 24 x 7 availability, and more about ensuring that our  archival  holdings are available for long-term access in a robust  storage fabric.<br /><br />A <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/11/icpsr-content-and-availability.html\">post from November 2009</a> is still an accurate depiction of how we replicate our archival   holdings so that we can be guaranteed to have a copy even if something   catastrophic happens to our main location in Ann Arbor.  I\'m also   interested in deploying copies outside the United States.  We\'ve had   some very useful conversations with colleagues at the <a href=\"http://anusf.anu.edu.au/\">ANU Supercomputer Facility</a> in Australia, and perhaps some sort of reciprocal storage arrangement might be worked out.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(170,57,'C.

Because this content is freely  available via our web site (albeit some only to members) there are  relatively few concerns about its security. It\'s important that we know  that the objects haven\'t been corrupted (unintentionally or otherwise),  and it\'s also important to ensure that member-only content is accessible  only to members.<br /><br />The second category has grown considerably in  the past few years, particularly as ICPSR receives more confidential  data through government agencies, partners, and unsolicited via its  deposit system.<br /><br />To meet the rising challenge of confidential data  ICPSR will be changing the architecture of its network, and will also  be deploying a Secure Data processing Environment. (More on the SDE in a  subsequent post.) Both of these steps supplement existing security  controls that we discussed in the post <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/09/icpsr-web-site-and-security.html\">The ICPSR Web Site and Security</a> from September 2009.<br /><br />Our  current network architecture is very flat. All network-connected  equipment is part of a single virtual local area network (VLAN), and  items are protected at the border between ICPSR and the outside world  via Cisco access-list policies. Individual systems may also be protected  via local firewalls, such as iptables on a Linux server. And equipment  located in Amazon\'s cloud is protected via similar mechanisms using AWS  EC2 Security Groups.<br /><br />Our new network architecture will look very different, and will consist of four separate VLANs. Here is the overall picture:</p><p>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2WmjUV0qSjA/S3mRnNlbz0I/AAAAAAAAAMw/uW4qtF0VNH0/s1600-h/ICPSR+LAN+with+VFW.png<br /><br />This  new architecture makes use of a new security service provided by the  University of Michigan\'s central IT organization, ITS. The service is  called Virtual Firewall, and is based on the Checkpoint firewall  product.<br /><br />This architecture divides ICPSR\'s network-connected resources into four VLANs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Public<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Semi-private<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Private (local to ICPSR)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Private (local to ITS)<br /><br />The  Public VLAN hosts ICPSR\'s public-facing resources, such as the web  server. This is a relatively small VLAN, and one can imagine resources  moving from this VLAN into Amazon\'s cloud over time. (In fact, a  multi-region delivery platform stretched across Amazon\'s international  cloud, perhaps using AWS CloudFront to deliver especially high-volume  objects is very compelling.)<br /><br />The Semi-private VLAN hosts the bulk  of ICPSR\'s current systems: desktop computers, printers, storage  systems, and so on. This equipment needs robust outbound access to the  Internet, but inbound access should be restricted closely. For example,  there is no good reason why ICPSR\'s printers need to be accessible from  any arbitrary host on the Internet.<br /><br />The Private VLANs will host  our most secure systems. This will include the Secure Data processing  Environment (SDE) we\'re building, and also a future Virtual Data Enclave  (VDE). Access between these VLANs and the Internet will be highly,  highly restricted, and more general access will be permitted only from  our Semi-private VLAN.<br /><br />We\'ve just started the process of building  out this future network architecture with ITS, and expect that we\'ll  finish the deployment and transition before the end of the summer.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(172,53,'C.

Roles and   responsibilities are known well, and the knowledge is common across work   groups.  We don\'t often hire completely new types of positions, and so   when we do hire a new employee, they tend to slot easily into an   existing category of employee (e.g., \"data processor\").<br /><br />The   combination of a category, or role, and the specific work group - such   as, the new hire, Jane, is a Data Processor in SAMHDA - translate easily   into a set of related technology containers such as Active Directory   groups, LDAP groups, old school UNIX /etc/group entries, and even our   own custom database that maps people to groups.<br /><br />My sense is that   the net effect is that we have roles that are well understood, but not   crisply defined; and we have containers to hold the roles, but those   containers are as idiosyncratic as the collection of technology we use   to drive ICPSR.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(173,3,'A.

That will give  the reader a good sense for how things are working today, but leaves  open the possibility (likelihood?) that ICPSR may change its mission  statement, submission agreements, and/or other possibilities down the  road, and then the underlying technology will change too.<br /><br />The  short version of the story is that ICPSR captures two essential items  from each submission: the data (normalized into plain ASCII characters),  and the technical documentation (normalized into DDI XML, PDF, and TIF  images). And we keep the content in these formats until we need to  migrate to a different format.<br /><br />In our world of survey research  data there is no requirement to preserve original formats (such as a SAS  Portable file), look and feel (such as original technical documentation  written in Word Perfect), or even low-level data format (such as  numeric data coded in punched card format). We can take everything, pull  out the essential intellectual content, and then normalize that content  in quite durable formats.<br /><br />That said, we may take these durable  formats, such as DDI XML metadata and plain ASCII data, and feed them  into tools that produce dissemination formats that are easier for our  designated community to use. This includes common stat package formats,  and also includes formats that feed into our on-line analysis system.  However, these dissemination formats are not preserved, and they contain  no essential properties not also contained in the preservation formats.<br /><br />As  I\'ve been thinking about this particular TRAC requirement over the past  week, I think we\'re probably missing one important piece of information  for each of our data files: the character set. In practice almost all  of our holdings are numeric data, and so our implicit character set  (\"us-ascii\") is the correct one to use, but this seems like a good area  for being more explicit. This would allow us to handle data files that  contain non-numeric, non-US-ASCII characters in a more durable  fashion.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(254,27,'B.

Upon  receipt of a deposit, ICPSR processes the digital content to ensure  that confidential information has not been included in the data;  corrects errors; fills gaps in the documentation; and produces  distribution versions of the data. Technicians digitize documentation  that is received only in hard copy format. ICPSR archives the original  digital content received, the normalized versions of processed data, and  superseded versions of data that have been distributed. The archived  files will enable ICPSR to retain the ability to regenerate distribution  formats over time. For files submitted on physical storage media, ICPSR  makes archival copies but does not preserve the original transmission  media.

Linux, of course, is a very widely deployed open source variant  of UNIX, and Red Hat is a world leader in supporting Linux. ICPSR had  previously used proprietary operating systems, but moved all of its  systems to Red Hat Linux in the decade.<br /><br />Moving up in the stack of  our core technology infrastructure we use several pieces of software  from the Apache Software Foundation, a very large community of  developers and users. In addition to the flagship HTTP Server, we also  use the tomcat servlet container for all of our Java-based web  applications, the Solr search engine which is built atop the Lucene Java  search technology, and the cocoon framework for rendering XML into  other formats.<br /><br />ICPSR also builds and maintains a suite of custom  software for key business processes, such as our Data Deposit Form  (ingest), our download system (access), and our data processing systems  (data management, ingest, access). While this software is necessarily  proprietary, it is written in common, modern software languages such as  Perl and Java, which have wide support in the community.<br /><br />Like  many, many enterprises, ICPSR uses Oracle as its database system. Given  the large installed base of Oracle across the world, ICPSR views this as  a well-supported platform. We believe we can continue to use Oracle as  long as the University of Michigan continues to make it freely available  to us. Further, we make use of only the most basic elements of Oracle,  and if required, it would be straight-forward, but not insignificant, to  migrate our content to any other relational database technology, such  as postgres or mysql. Our one highly customized use of Oracle, and  therefore the one that carries the most risk, is the OracleText-based  search engine for the Child Care site, is scheduled to be replaced in  early 2010.<br /><br />And finally, we are actively migrating our own  proprietary archival storage system to the Fedora system, which is  supported by the newly created DuraSpace organization. Other than  internally created systems, Fedora probably has the smallest community  of support of any of our major technology systems, but because it is  open source and gaining traction in the community, we believe its level  of support will continue to grow over time. And further, because the  underlying content resides in plain XML files, even with a sudden and  catastrophic loss of Fedora, it would still be possible to migrate  content to another system.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(298,63,'C.

The documentation - planning documents  and instructions - reside in a Google Group, and all members of the IT  team, and two of ICPSR\'s senior staff outside of IT are members of the  group. The process has been used twice in 2009, once as a test, and once  when the Ann Arbor site suffered a power failure.<br /><br />ICPSR has a  less well documented, but fairly prosaic, backup solution in place. All  non-ephemeral content at ICPSR resides on a large Network Attached  Storage (NAS) appliance. The IT team has configured the NAS to  \"checkpoint\" each filesystem once per day, and each checkpoint is  retained for 30 days. Checkpoints provide a read-only, self-serve backup  system for those instances where a member of the staff has  inadvertently damaged or destroyed non-archival content.<br /><br />Further,  we write all filesystems to a tape library, which is located in a  different machine room than the NAS. Every two weeks tapes are removed  from the tape library, and stored in yet a different building. We retain  the last four weekly backups, and the last twelve monthly backups. The  system is exercised on an infrequent, but regular basis when we restore  files that were damaged or destroyed beyond the thirty day checkpoint  window.<br /><br />Finally, unlike \"working\" files where all copies reside  locally, and where we retain only one year of content, our archival  storage solution consists of copies in at least four locations. The  master copy (1) is on the NAS; a copy (2) is written to tape each month;  a copy (3) is synchronized daily with the San Diego Supercomputer  Center\'s storage grid; and, a copy (4) is synchronized daily with the  MATRIX Center at Michigan State University. Furthermore, archival  content collected prior to 2009 has also been copied into the  Chronopolis project storage grid, which adds two additional copies.<br /><br />One  area with room for improvement would be regular \"fire drills\" where we  would attempt to retrieve a random number of random objects from an  arbitrarily selected archival storage location.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(300,73,'C.

And for the second (tape) copy, we too can easily specify the  location as long as we\'re not too specific. For example, we can point to  the tape library and say, \"It\'s in there.\" And, of course, with a  little more work, we can use our tape management system to point us to  the specific tape, and the location on that tape. Maintaining this  information outside of the tape management system would be expensive,  and it\'s not clear if there would be any true benefit.<br /><br />The  location of other copies can be derived easily, but those specific  locations are not recorded in a database. For example, let\'s say that  the master copy of every original deposit we have is stored in a  filesystem hierarchy like /archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s say that on a daily basis we synchronize that content via <em>rsync </em>to an off-site location, say, <strong>remote-location.icpsr.umich.edu:</strong>/archival-storage/deposits/<em>deposit-id/</em>. And let\'s also say that someone reviews the output of the <em>rsync </em>run on a daily basis, and also performs a random spot-check on an irregular basis.<br /><br />In  this scenario we might have a large degree of confidence that we could  find a copy of any given deposit on that off-site location. We know it\'s  there because <em>rsync </em>told us it put it there. But we don\'t have a  central catalog that says that deposit #1234 is stored under  /archival-storage/deposits/1234, on tape, and at  remote-site.icpsr.umich.edu/archival-storage/deposits/1234. One could  build exactly such a catalog, of course, and then create the process to  keep it up to date, but would it have much value? What if all we did was  tell a wrapper around rsync to capture the output and update the  catalog?<br /><br />Probably not.<br /><br />And so if we interpret the TRAC  requirement to build a location register to mean that we should have a  complete, enumerated list of each and every copy, then we don\'t do so  well here. But if we interpret the requirement to mean that we can find a  copy by looking on a list (i.e., the catalog proper) or look at a rule  (i.e., if the master copy is in location x, then two other copies can be  found by applying functions <em>f(x)</em> and <em>g(x)</em>), then we\'re doing pretty well after all.<br /><br />Limitations  in storage systems also add complexity. For instance, I was once  looking at Amazon\'s S3 as a possible location for items in archival  storage. But S3 doesn\'t let me have objects bigger than 5GB, and since I  sometimes have very large files, this means that the record-keeping  would be even more complicated. <em>For an object with name X, you can  find it in this S3 bucket, unless it is bigger than 5GB, in which case  you need to look for N different objects and join them together.</em> Ick.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(301,72,'C.

One common problem, for example, occurs when an  object larger than 2GB enters Archival Storage and the SRB Srsync  utility faults. (SRB limits objects to 2GB.) We then remove this object  from the list of items to be synchronized with SRB.<br /><br />Because the  synchronization process is incremental, it has a very short duration.  However, if we were to need to synchronize ALL content, this takes on  the order of days or even weeks. For example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Access holdings to a computing instance residing in  Amazon\'s EC2 EU-West region, and we found it took approximately one week  to copy about 500GB. As another example, we recently synchronized a  copy of our Archival Storage (which is much larger than the Access  collection) to a system, which like ICPSR and the University of  Michigan, is connected to Internet2\'s Abilene network, and that took far  less time.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,1),(302,70,'C.

Fortunately for our data holdings (but unfortunately for TRAC  preparation), data loss or corruption is a very infrequent event, and  therefore as one might expect, the set of policies and written processes  is pretty small.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, if we look at our  policies and processes for handling loss with \"working files\" we will  find a much richer set of policies and systems. We have established  infrastructure (an EMC Network Attached Storage (NAS) storage applicance  and associated Dell tape management solution); we have internal  policies and processes that document how to retrieve lost content; we  have external policies that describe which parts of the NAS are written  to tape, and the schedule of tape backups; and, we exercise the system  on a regular basis as people inadvertently delete or damage files with  which they are working actively.<br /><br />On the Archival Storage side -  or even the Access side, where we also look for loss and corruption -  the number of data loss or data corruption events is very, very low.  Email reports come out on a regular basis, but they always (almost) say  that everything is fine. And on that rare occasion where there is an  issue, the remedy is quick.<br /><br />Perhaps the right solution here is to  use the small sample of issues that have arisen over the years as our  baseline for writing up a process, and then posting that process on our  internal web site. That would be easy to do. But then the concern is  this: If a policy is used very, very infrequently, it is likely to fall  into disrepair. It is also likely to become forgotten.

If most campuses were using, say, IBM labeled  cartridge tapes routinely but ICPSR was sending ANSI labeled 9-track  tapes, this would have imposed an additional burden on our designated  community. However, in a world where the typical access is via a Web  download, the underlying hardware selection - disk, server, router,  switch - just doesn\'t matter all that much.<br /><br />Also, because ICPSR\'s  unit of delivery is relatively small - most of our content is on the  order of megabytes - issues such as network bandwidth are not critical.  In a typical day ICPSR might deliver 20GB of content to hundreds or even  thousands of separate sessions, and so with even modest networking  resources (1 Gb/s NIC, 1 Gb/s switch, 10 Gb/s campus backbone, etc), the  \"pipes\" are more than sufficient to deliver good service.<br /><br />One  interesting area to consider with regard to hardware selection is  virtualization. For example, in some cases it might make more sense for a  depositor to leave ICPSR with an image of a complete computing system  in addition to a dataset. In most cases the deposit contains simple  rectangular data that can be normalized relatively easily into plain  character data and accompanying \"setups\" to make it easy to use with the  most common statistical packages. However, if the dataset were more  complex - say a relational database - then normalizing the data could be  prohibitively expensive, or damaging to the data, or both.

It\'s important that we know  that the objects haven\'t been corrupted (unintentionally or otherwise),  and it\'s also important to ensure that member-only content is accessible  only to members.<br /><br />The second category has grown considerably in  the past few years, particularly as ICPSR receives more confidential  data through government agencies, partners, and unsolicited via its  deposit system.<br /><br />To meet the rising challenge of confidential data  ICPSR will be changing the architecture of its network, and will also  be deploying a Secure Data processing Environment. (More on the SDE in a  subsequent post.) Both of these steps supplement existing security  controls that we discussed in the post <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/09/icpsr-web-site-and-security.html\">The ICPSR Web Site and Security</a> from September 2009.<br /><br />Our  current network architecture is very flat. All network-connected  equipment is part of a single virtual local area network (VLAN), and  items are protected at the border between ICPSR and the outside world  via Cisco access-list policies. Individual systems may also be protected  via local firewalls, such as iptables on a Linux server. And equipment  located in Amazon\'s cloud is protected via similar mechanisms using AWS  EC2 Security Groups.<br /><br />Our new network architecture will look very different, and will consist of four separate VLANs. Here is the overall picture:</p><p>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2WmjUV0qSjA/S3mRnNlbz0I/AAAAAAAAAMw/uW4qtF0VNH0/s1600-h/ICPSR+LAN+with+VFW.png<br /><br />This  new architecture makes use of a new security service provided by the  University of Michigan\'s central IT organization, ITS. The service is  called Virtual Firewall, and is based on the Checkpoint firewall  product.<br /><br />This architecture divides ICPSR\'s network-connected resources into four VLANs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Public<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Semi-private<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Private (local to ICPSR)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Private (local to ITS)<br /><br />The  Public VLAN hosts ICPSR\'s public-facing resources, such as the web  server. This is a relatively small VLAN, and one can imagine resources  moving from this VLAN into Amazon\'s cloud over time. (In fact, a  multi-region delivery platform stretched across Amazon\'s international  cloud, perhaps using AWS CloudFront to deliver especially high-volume  objects is very compelling.)<br /><br />The Semi-private VLAN hosts the bulk  of ICPSR\'s current systems: desktop computers, printers, storage  systems, and so on. This equipment needs robust outbound access to the  Internet, but inbound access should be restricted closely. For example,  there is no good reason why ICPSR\'s printers need to be accessible from  any arbitrary host on the Internet.<br /><br />The Private VLANs will host  our most secure systems. This will include the Secure Data processing  Environment (SDE) we\'re building, and also a future Virtual Data Enclave  (VDE). Access between these VLANs and the Internet will be highly,  highly restricted, and more general access will be permitted only from  our Semi-private VLAN.<br /><br />We\'ve just started the process of building  out this future network architecture with ITS, and expect that we\'ll  finish the deployment and transition before the end of the summer.\"</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(311,53,'C.

But there are two key areas  worth  discussing that fall within the purview of IT.<br /><br />One area is   ensuring that ICPSR is able to deliver its content to its clients,   members, and the public at all time.  This is an area where we\'ve made   significant investments over the past twelve months, and where we also   now have a good story to tell.<br /><br />The main ICPSR delivery mechanism   is its web site.  The technological resources that power the primary   instance of the web site reside at ICPSR itself on the campus of the   University of Michigan.  This consists of three mains systems:  a   reasonably powerful server running web applications; another powerful   server running an Oracle database; and our storage appliance.<br /><br />Our   equipment resides in an eclectic machine room.  On the plus side it  has  items one would expect to find like equipment cabinets, local air   handlers providing chilled air, and UPS to protect us from power   fluctuations.  On the negative side there is no raised floor or cable   trays, which makes for a messy machine room, and our connection to Ann   Arbor\'s (not U-M\'s) electrical grid is somewhat precarious.  An off-site   network operations center monitors our gear 24 x 7 and notifies us via   SMS, pager, and telephone if anything looks broken.<br /><br />We maintain  a  replica of our web environment in Amazon\'s cloud, and we use a  simple  mechanism to trigger a failover to the replica:  The oncall  technician  changes the DNS record for www.icpsr.umich.edu to point to  the replica  instead of the primary.  The time-to-live on the record is  low (five  minutes), and so once the process has been followed, failover  is quick.   (And the change is made on a \"stealth\" DNS server that also  lives in  Amazon\'s cloud.)<br /><br />And, finally, we synchronize the replica several times throughout the workday so that software and content is always fresh.<br /><br />This   setup doesn\'t create a web environment which promises \"five nines\"  type  of uptime (i.e., 99.999% availability), but it does give us the   capability to avoid any long multi-day outage like we saw late in 2008,   and it also gives us the capability to deliver content indefinitely  from  the replica should ICPSR stuffer a disaster.<br /><br />The second  main  area where IT plays a key role is with archival storage.  This is  less  about 24 x 7 availability, and more about ensuring that our  archival  holdings are available for long-term access in a robust  storage fabric.<br /><br />A <a href=\"http://techaticpsr.blogspot.com/2009/11/icpsr-content-and-availability.html\">post from November 2009</a> is still an accurate depiction of how we replicate our archival   holdings so that we can be guaranteed to have a copy even if something   catastrophic happens to our main location in Ann Arbor.  I\'m also   interested in deploying copies outside the United States.  We\'ve had   some very useful conversations with colleagues at the <a href=\"http://anusf.anu.edu.au/\">ANU Supercomputer Facility</a> in Australia, and perhaps some sort of reciprocal storage arrangement might be worked out.\"&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,NULL,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,1),(313,3,'A.

There is an auditor role with a separate log-in that can see all of the content on the site and has exclusive editing rights to an audit comment field.&nbsp; Organization’s can incorporate the auditor role into their TRAC review process. One possible approach might be to freeze the content and effectively turning the site over to one or more auditors for a period of time then reviewing the results. The TRAC Review site is intentionally not prescriptive about how the site is used so any organization can use it.</p><h2>TRAC Requirements</h2><p>This TRAC Review site reflects the requirements as defined in the CCSDS Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories <a title=\"checklist\" href=\"http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf\">checklist</a> that was approved as ISO 16363 in 2012. &nbsp;ISO 16363 is based on the Trustworthy Repository Audit and Certification (<a href=\"http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf\">TRAC</a>): Criteria and Checklist that was developed by the RLG/NARA Task Force beginning in 2003 and released for public use in January 2007. The requirements pages reflect the 2012 version of the requirements with a link to the relevant 2007 version of the requirement. All of the information from the CCSDS document is included in this TRAC review site.</p><h2>Process</h2><p>This site incorporates an optional approach to roles and responsibilities that adopts the <a href=\"http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_raci.html\">RA(S)CI</a> project management roles as described on the Responsibilities page (see links for information about those aspects).&nbsp; The process envisioned in using this TRAC Review site includes completing the following steps for each requirement (noting optional steps):</p><ul><li><strong><em>Identify <a href=\"/trac/responsibilities\">roles</a></em></strong>: e.g., senior management, preservation, rights management&nbsp; (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Assign <a href=\"/trac/responsibilities\">responsibilities</a></em></strong>: e.g., responsible, accountable, support, consulted, informed (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Enter evidence</em></strong>: note who provided what evidence when using the examples from the CCSDS document as a guide to provide a cumulative record and to show progress (Required)</li><li><strong><em>Determine a compliance <a href=\"/trac/trac-review-process-and-progress\">rating</a></em></strong>:&nbsp; the is a determination of compliance by the organization completing the review based on available evidence at a point in time (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Track status</em></strong>: enter the current status for identifying evidence for each requirement (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Define action items</em></strong>: identify steps needed to increase compliance (Optional, default setting = not public)</li><li><strong><em>Add notes: </em></strong>enter any notes that will be helpful to the process, e.g., assist in prioritizing actions or identify organizational changes that might affect the status. &nbsp;(Optional, default setting = not public)</li><li><strong><em>Share your results and experiences</em></strong>: every digital repository would benefit from a self-assessment process using the TRAC requirement as a frame, all organizations&nbsp; will benefit from shared experiences</li></ul><p>NOTE:&nbsp; The default setting is for the content to be public except for action items and notes, but organizations can change those settings locally. Identifying roles and responsibilities for requirements has proven to be an effective way for organizations to engage staff across the organization in completing a TRAC review.&nbsp; The compliance ratings and status tracking options allow an organization to manage a TRAC review like a project showing progress and meeting milestones. An organization can choose not to do optional steps and still effectively use this TRAC Review site.</p><h2>TRAC Review Site Content</h2><p>This TRAC Review site consists of:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Home</em></strong>: provides a brief introduction to the site, links to a page for each TRAC requirement displaying its current compliance rating and status, and a summary that reflects cumulative compliance ratings the three sections of TRAC</li><li><strong><em>Responsibilities</em></strong>: describes optional roles and responsibilities an organization can assign to individuals and units and links to each stakeholder group to review the status of its assigned requirements</li><li><strong><em>Requirements</em></strong>: provides all of the information in the CCSDS about each TRAC requirement and fields that can be edited by authenticated users to indicate roles, responsibilities, compliance rating, action items, and notes the organization can enter for each requirement</li></ul><h2>Development Milestones</h2><p><strong>2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Version 1.0 was initiated and specified by Nancy McGovern using the 2007 TRAC requirements for internal use by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, with the technical development completed by Matthew Richardson and Michael Iannaccone.</p><p><strong>2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Version 2.0 was initiated and specified by Nancy McGovern using the 2012 version of the TRAC requirements for the Digital Preservation Management workshop series that is hosted by MIT Libraries implementation, with content management by Liz Francis and technical development by Matt Bernhardt.</p><p><strong>2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The TRAC Review site files are available for download from <a href=\"http://www.artefactual.com/index.html\">Artefactual</a> Systems as a tarball that contains a complete and standalone Drupal instance.&nbsp;</p><p>This is version 2.0 of the TRAC Review site. It has been reviewed by a few organizations. There are no specific plans to extend or update the site.&nbsp; Organizations are welcome to use and extend the site and hopefully share their developments.</p><h2>Advice and Assistance</h2><p>The TRAC Review site is available open source and as is for organizations to use.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If you have questions about implementing or using Drupal, you should be able to find local or online Drupal assistance.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have questions about completing a TRAC Review, one source of advice and information is the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/working_groups/standards.html\">Standards</a> working group that is working on guidance for conducting a peer review audit.</li></ul>','','plain_text');

However, this requirement does not demand that each repository has such tools and resources, merely that it has access to them. For example a repository may access external registries.1 Any such registry is a specialized type of repository, which itself must be certified/trustworthy. The repository may use these types of standardized, authoritative information sources to identify and/or verify the Representation Information components of Content Information and PDI. This will reduce the long-term maintenance costs to the repository and improve quality control. Sometimes there is both general Representation Information (e.g., format information) and specific Representation Information (e.g., meanings of individual fields within a dataset). Often the general information will be available in an external repository, but the local repository may need to maintain the instance-specific information. It is likely that many repositories would wish to keep local copies of relevant Representation Information; however, this may not be practical in all cases. Even where a repository strives to keep all such information locally there may be, for example, a schedule of updates which means that until an update is performed, the local Representation Information is incomplete. This may be regarded as a kind of local caching of, for example, the Representation Information held in registries.

Such tests might be simple (counting the number of records in a file, or performing some simple statistical measure), but they might be complex. Documentation should describe how the completeness and correctness of AIPs is ensured, starting with receipt from the producer and continuing through AIP creation and supporting long-term preservation.

For example, if a repository claims to have all e-mail sent or received by The Yoyodyne Corporation between 1985 and 2005, it has been required to show that: – the content it holds came from Yoyodyne’s e-mail servers; – it is all correctly transformed into a preservation format; – each monthly SIP of e-mail has been correctly preserved, including original unique identifiers such as Message-IDs. However, it may still have no way of showing whether this really represents all of Yoyodyne’s email. For example, if there is a three-day period with no messages in the repository, is this because Yoyodyne was shut down for those three days, or because the email was lost before the SIP was constructed?

When evidence already exists, the responsible group will document the evidence of compliance, e.g., by linking to an existing online policy or procedure, or posting the policy or procedures either for internal or public access.&nbsp;&nbsp;A more narrative form for capturing evidence, such as blog posts or other written descriptions of&nbsp;relevant efforts, may be effective,&nbsp;especially when the action or outcome required by TRAC is already in place, but these actions (procedures and practices) have not yet been documented.&nbsp;The TDR Self-asessment and Audit (aka TRAC Review) pages provide a framework for capturing documentation and documenting the status of TDR compliance, so each group should adapt the requirements pages for their own use.

These webpages support a self-assessment and audit (aka TRAC Review) method for an organization to demonstrate&nbsp;good practice and conformance&nbsp;as a trusted digital repository (TDR) to its designated communities and prepare for a peer review or other external audit. In many organizations, responsibilities for TDR compliance are distributed throughout the organization, with specific units and committees having certain responsibilities for each requirement.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities<br /></strong>Each entity is assigned a role for each requirement using the RACI responsibility assignment matrix. The RACI Matrix describes participation by various organizational roles in completing tasks for a project. RACI is especially useful in clarifying roles in projects and processes requiring distributed responsibilities. See the <a href=\"/trac/node/3\">Responsibilities</a>&nbsp;for TDR Self-assessment and Audit page for more information on RACI responsibilities, and a listing of units and committees that have roles in TRAC conformance.</p><p><strong>Requirements<br /></strong>Each TDR requirement&nbsp;has its own page. Sub- and Sub-sub requirements are referred to on the relevant high-level requirement page. Current compliance with TDR requirements is assessed on a rating system from 0 to 4 (see example: <a href=\"/trac/sites/default/files/SGDS%202009-9421%20%28D.%20BOUCON%29.pdf\">SGDS report</a>, page 14):<br />&nbsp; <strong>4</strong> = fully compliant - the repository can demonstrate that has comprehensively addressed the requirement<br />&nbsp; <strong>3</strong> = mostly compliant - the repository&nbsp;can demonstrate that it&nbsp;has mostly addressed the requirement and&nbsp;is&nbsp;on working on full compliance<br />&nbsp; <strong>2</strong> = half compliant - the repository has partially addressed the requirement and has&nbsp;significant work&nbsp;remaining to fully address the requirement<br />&nbsp; <strong>1</strong> = slightly compliant - the repositroy has something in place, but has a&nbsp;lot of work to do in addressing the requirement&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <strong>0</strong> = non-compliant or not started - the repository has not yet addressed the requirement or has not started the review of the requirement<br />Any group&nbsp;in the organization&nbsp;that is involved in defining policy and practice should update the status of relevant requirements. When listing evidence, please include sufficient information for reviewers to get to the cited evidence (e.g., a document title, date, a link) and note the name of the group or department that is adding an entry to the evidence addressing the requirement along with the date of the annotations (e.g., [Right Management group, 2/13/2013]).

of digital content to completing a TRAC Review as a means to demonstrate its alignment with prevailing digital curation and preservation standards and good practice.</p><p>The site supports both self-assessment and preparation for an external audit. There is an auditor role with a separate log-in that can see all of the content on the site and has exclusive editing rights to an audit comment field.&nbsp; Organization’s can incorporate the auditor role into their TRAC review process. One possible approach might be to freeze the content and effectively turning the site over to one or more auditors for a period of time then reviewing the results. The TRAC Review site is intentionally not prescriptive about how the site is used so any organization can use it.</p><h2>TRAC Requirements</h2><p>This TRAC Review site reflects the requirements as defined in the CCSDS Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories <a title=\"checklist\" href=\"http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf\">checklist</a> that was approved as ISO 16363 in 2012. &nbsp;ISO 16363 is based on the Trustworthy Repository Audit and Certification (<a href=\"http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf\">TRAC</a>): Criteria and Checklist that was developed by the RLG/NARA Task Force beginning in 2003 and released for public use in January 2007. The requirements pages reflect the 2012 version of the requirements with a link to the relevant 2007 version of the requirement. All of the information from the CCSDS document is included in this TRAC review site.</p><h2>Process</h2><p>This site incorporates an optional approach to roles and responsibilities that adopts the <a href=\"http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_raci.html\">RA(S)CI</a> project management roles as described on the Responsibilities page (see links for information about those aspects).&nbsp; The process envisioned in using this TRAC Review site includes completing the following steps for each requirement (noting optional steps):</p><ul><li><strong><em>Identify <a href=\"/trac/responsibilities\">roles</a></em></strong>: e.g., senior management, preservation, rights management&nbsp; (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Assign <a href=\"/trac/responsibilities\">responsibilities</a></em></strong>: e.g., responsible, accountable, support, consulted, informed (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Enter evidence</em></strong>: note who provided what evidence when using the examples from the CCSDS document as a guide to provide a cumulative record and to show progress (Required)</li><li><strong><em>Determine a compliance <a href=\"/trac/trac-review-process-and-progress\">rating</a></em></strong>:&nbsp; the is a determination of compliance by the organization completing the review based on available evidence at a point in time (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Track status</em></strong>: enter the current status for identifying evidence for each requirement (Optional)</li><li><strong><em>Define action items</em></strong>: identify steps needed to increase compliance (Optional, default setting = not public)</li><li><strong><em>Add notes: </em></strong>enter any notes that will be helpful to the process, e.g., assist in prioritizing actions or identify organizational changes that might affect the status. &nbsp;(Optional, default setting = not public)</li><li><strong><em>Share your results and experiences</em></strong>: every digital repository would benefit from a self-assessment process using the TRAC requirement as a frame, all organizations&nbsp; will benefit from shared experiences</li></ul><p>NOTE:&nbsp; The default setting is for the content to be public except for action items and notes, but organizations can change those settings locally. Identifying roles and responsibilities for requirements has proven to be an effective way for organizations to engage staff across the organization in completing a TRAC review.&nbsp; The compliance ratings and status tracking options allow an organization to manage a TRAC review like a project showing progress and meeting milestones. An organization can choose not to do optional steps and still effectively use this TRAC Review site.</p><h2>TRAC Review Site Content</h2><p>This TRAC Review site consists of:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Home</em></strong>: provides a brief introduction to the site, links to a page for each TRAC requirement displaying its current compliance rating and status, and a summary that reflects cumulative compliance ratings the three sections of TRAC</li><li><strong><em>Responsibilities</em></strong>: describes optional roles and responsibilities an organization can assign to individuals and units and links to each stakeholder group to review the status of its assigned requirements</li><li><strong><em>Requirements</em></strong>: provides all of the information in the CCSDS about each TRAC requirement and fields that can be edited by authenticated users to indicate roles, responsibilities, compliance rating, action items, and notes the organization can enter for each requirement</li></ul><h2>Development Milestones</h2><p><strong>2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Version 1.0 was initiated and specified by Nancy McGovern using the 2007 TRAC requirements for internal use by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, with the technical development completed by Matthew Richardson and Michael Iannaccone.</p><p><strong>2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Version 2.0 was initiated and specified by Nancy McGovern using the 2012 version of the TRAC requirements for the Digital Preservation Management workshop series that is hosted by MIT Libraries implementation, with content management by Liz Francis and technical development by Matt Bernhardt.</p><p><strong>2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The TRAC Review site files are available for download from <a href=\"http://www.artefactual.com/index.html\">Artefactual</a> Systems as a tarball that contains a complete and standalone Drupal instance.&nbsp;</p><p>This is version 2.0 of the TRAC Review site. It has been reviewed by a few organizations. There are no specific plans to extend or update the site.&nbsp; Organizations are welcome to use and extend the site and hopefully share their developments.</p><h2>Advice and Assistance</h2><p>The TRAC Review site is available open source and as is for organizations to use.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If you have questions about implementing or using Drupal, you should be able to find local or online Drupal assistance.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have questions about completing a TRAC Review, one source of advice and information is the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/working_groups/standards.html\">Standards</a> working group that is working on guidance for conducting a peer review audit.</li></ul>','','plain_text');

For example, if there is a three-day period with no messages in the repository, is this because Yoyodyne was shut down for those three days, or because the email was lost before the SIP was constructed? This case could be resolved by the repository’s amending its description of the collection, but other cases may not be so straightforward. A familiar mechanism from the world of traditional materials in libraries and archives is an accessions or acquisitions register that is independent of other catalog metadata. A repository should be able to show, for each item in its accessions register, which AIP(s) contain content from that item. Alternatively, it may need to show that there is no AIP for an item, either because ingest is still in progress, or because the item was rejected for some reason.

This is a key part of establishing that DIPs reflect the content of  AIPs, and hence of original material, in a trustworthy and consistent  fashion.

A user may request a DIP  consisting of the title pages from all e-books published in a given  period, for instance, which will require these to be extracted from many  different AIPs. A repository that allows requests for such complex DIPs  will need to put more effort into demonstrating how it meets this  requirement than a repository that only allows requests for DIPs that  correspond to an entire AIP.</blockquote><blockquote><p>A repository is  not required to show that every DIP it provides can be verified as  authentic at a later date; it must show that it can do this when it is  required at the time of production of the DIP.

documentation examples first review each of the iso 16363 requirements for which your group is responsible make quick progress by determining which requirements are already in place and are either already documented or might be easy to document next determine the requirements that will require review or contributions by one or more members of the group these subgroups will bring recommendations back to the group for each requirement the responsible group will determine the kinds of assistance needed from groups with a supporting role seek feedback at appropriate points eg when drafts are prepared about specific topics from groups with a consulting role provide updates and report on outcomes to groups with an accountable role or an informed role groups that should be aware of the results document how the repository has addressed or will address the requirement accountable for these requirements the accountable group will actively track progress on documenting compliance maintain contact with the lead group until the requirement review is completed compliance is documented and relevant next steps are determined when applicable ensure that the responsible group documents their progress on drupal support for these requirements the support group should offer assistance to the lead group contact the responsible group to coordinate efforts contribute to the documentation for these requirements upon request by the lead group consulted for these requirements the consulted group should coordinate with the lead group to determine when and how to provide feedback contact the responsible group to determine your group s role in the process determine how your group s expertise or position within the organization can best assist the responsible group informed for these requirements the informed group will track progress by lead group to ensure awareness of the status though the informed role sounds passive it involves active awareness of the process and results contact the responsible group to learn about the planned approach for these requirements compiling and generating documentation to address requirements for each requirement the responsible role leads on compiling and or generating relevant evidence when evidence already exists the responsible group will document the evidence of compliance eg by linking to an existing online policy or procedure or posting the policy or procedures either for internal or public access a more narrative form for capturing evidence such as blog posts or other written descriptions of relevant efforts may be effective especially when the action or outcome required by trac is already in place but these actions procedures and practices have not yet been documented the tdr selfasessment and

trustworthy the repository may use these types of standardized authoritative information sources to identify and or verify the representation information components of content information and pdi this

information eg meanings of individual fields within a dataset often the general information will be available in an external repository but the local repository may need to maintain the

repository strives to keep all such information locally there may be for example a schedule of updates which means that until an update is performed the local representation information is incomplete this may be regarded as a kind of local caching of for example the representation information held in registries alternatively one may say that in these cases the use of international registries is not meant to replace local registries but instead serve as a resource to verify or obtain independent authoritative information about any and all representation information good practice suggests that

initial checks were carried out successfully and that the transformation process was carried out without indicating errors on the other hand repositories that must create unique processes for many of their aips will also need to generate unique methods for validating the completeness and correctness of aips this may include performing tests of some sort on the content of the aip that can be compared with tests on the sip such tests might be simple counting the number of records in a file or performing some simple statistical measure but they might be complex documentation should describe

requirement it demonstrates the importance of being able to audit the integrity of the collection as a whole for example if a repository claims to have all email sent or received by the yoyodyne

of email has been correctly preserved including original unique identifiers such as messageids however it may still have no way of showing whether this really represents all of yoyodyne s email for example if there is a threeday period with no messages in the repository is this because yoyodyne was shut down for those three days or because the email was lost before the sip was constructed this case could be resolved by the repository s amending its description of the collection but other cases may not be so straightforward a familiar mechanism from the world of traditional materials in

repository 2 contains some images such as medical xrays that are intended for computer analysis rather than viewing by the human eye and other images that are like those in repository 1 repository 2

for the longterm management of digital content to completing a trac review as a means to demonstrate its alignment with prevailing digital curation and preservation standards and good practice the site supports both selfassessment and preparation for an external audit there is an auditor role with a separate login that can see all of the content on the site and has exclusive editing rights to an audit comment field organization s can incorporate the auditor role into their trac review process one possible approach might be to freeze the content and effectively turning the site over to one or more auditors for a period of time then reviewing the results the trac review site is intentionally not prescriptive about how the site is used so any organization can use it trac requirements this trac review site reflects the requirements as defined in the ccsds audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories checklist that was approved as iso 16363 in 2012 iso 16363 is based on the trustworthy repository audit and certification  trac  criteria and checklist that was developed by the rlg nara task force beginning in 2003 and released for public use in january 2007 the requirements pages reflect the 2012 version of the requirements with a link to the relevant 2007 version of the requirement all of the information from the ccsds document is included in this trac review site process this site incorporates an optional approach to roles and responsibilities that adopts the ra s ci project management roles as described on the responsibilities page see links for information about those aspects the process envisioned in using this trac review site includes completing the following steps for each requirement noting optional steps  identify roles  eg senior management preservation rights management optional  assign responsibilities  eg responsible accountable support consulted informed optional  enter evidence  note who provided what evidence when using the examples from the ccsds document as a guide to provide a cumulative record and to show progress required  determine a compliance rating  the is a determination of compliance by the organization completing the review based on available evidence at a point in time optional  track status  enter the current status for identifying evidence for each requirement optional  define action items  identify steps needed to increase compliance optional default setting not public  add notes  enter any notes that will be helpful to the process eg assist in prioritizing actions or identify organizational changes that might affect the status optional default setting not public  share your results and experiences  every digital repository would benefit from a selfassessment process using the trac requirement as a frame all organizations will benefit from shared experiences note the default setting is for the content to be public except for action items and notes but organizations can change those settings locally identifying roles and responsibilities for requirements has proven to be an effective way for organizations to engage staff across the organization in completing a trac review the compliance ratings and status tracking options allow an organization to manage a trac review like a project showing progress and meeting milestones an organization can choose not to do optional steps and still effectively use this trac review site trac review site content this trac review site consists of  home  provides a brief introduction to the site links to a page for each trac requirement displaying its current compliance rating and status and a summary that reflects cumulative compliance ratings the three sections of trac responsibilities  describes optional roles and responsibilities an organization can assign to individuals and units and links to each stakeholder group to review the status of its assigned requirements requirements  provides all of the information in the ccsds about each trac requirement and fields that can be edited by authenticated users to indicate roles responsibilities compliance rating action items and notes the organization can enter for each requirement development milestones 2008  version 10 was initiated and specified by nancy mcgovern using the 2007 trac requirements for internal use by the interuniversity consortium for political and social research with the technical development completed by matthew richardson and michael iannaccone 2013  version 20 was initiated and specified by nancy mcgovern using the 2012 version of the trac requirements for the digital preservation management workshop series that is hosted by mit libraries implementation with content management by liz francis and technical development by matt bernhardt 2013  the trac review site files are available for download from artefactual systems as a tarball that contains a complete and standalone drupal instance this is version 20 of the trac review site it has been reviewed by a few organizations there are no specific plans to extend or update the site organizations are welcome to use and extend the site and hopefully share their developments advice and assistance the trac review site is available open source and as is for organizations to use if you have questions about implementing or using drupal you should be able to find local or online drupal assistance if you have questions about completing a trac review one source of advice and information is the national digital stewardship alliance ndsa  standards working group

A repository must create documentation that reflects its Mission Statement and Strategic Plan and captures its normal activities. This entails documenting all repository processes, decision-making, and goal setting. Documentation is provided so that the activities of the repository will be understood by stakeholders and management. It ensures that repository policies and procedures are carried out in approved, consistent ways, resulting in long-term preservation and access to digital content in its care. Certification, the clearest indicator of a repository’s sound and standards-based practice, is facilitated by procedural accountability and documentation.</p>','plain_text',2),(11,3,'3.4 Financial Sustainability','','plain_text',3),(12,3,'3.5 Contracts, Licenses and Liabilities','','plain_text',4),(13,3,'4.1 Ingest: Acquisition of Content','','plain_text',0),(14,3,'4.2 Ingest: Creation of the AIP','','plain_text',1),(15,3,'4.3 Preservation Planning','','plain_text',2),(16,3,'4.4 AIP Preservation','','plain_text',3),(17,3,'4.5 Information Management','','plain_text',4),(18,3,'4.6 Access Management','<p>The term ‘access’ has a number of different senses, including access by users to the repository system, for example, physical security and user authentication, and the different stages of accessing records (making a request, verifying the rights of the requester, and preparing and sending a Dissemination Information Package [DIP]). This subsection is concerned with all of these. It is divided into two main requirements, one concerned with the existence and implementation of access policies, and one with the capacity of the repository to provide demonstrably authentic objects as DIPs. Thus the first requirement relates to requests initiated by a user and how the repository handles them to ensure that rights and<br />agreements are respected, that security is monitored, that requests are fulfilled, etc. The second requirement relates to what is delivered to the Consumer and the trust that can be placed in it.</p><p>It must be understood that the capabilities and sophistication of the access system will vary depending on the repository’s Designated Community and the access mandates of the repository.
